Falcon Middleware: Require HTTPS |Build Status| |codecov.io|
============================================================

The ``falcon-require-https`` package provides a middleware component
for sanity-checking that the incoming request was received over
HTTPS. While the web server is primarily responsibile for enforcing the
HTTPS protocol, misconfiguration is still a leading cause of security
vulnerabilities, and so it can be helpful to perform certain additional
checks, such as this one, within the application layer itself.

Installation
------------

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install falcon-require-https

Usage
-----

The ``RequireHTTPS`` middleware class verifies each incoming request. To use
it, simply pass an instance to the ``falcon.API()`` initializer:

.. code:: python

    from falcon_require_https import RequireHTTPS

    app = falcon.API(middleware=[RequireHTTPS()])

At least one of the following sources must indicate the use of HTTPS:

* The schema of the requested URL
* The X-Forwarded-Proto header
* The Forwarded header (only the first hop is checked)

Otherwise, an instance of ``falcon.HTTPBadRequest`` is raised.

Caution
-------

This middleware is not meant to replace proper security controls in your
web server or load balancer. It is simply meant as a final backstop to
guard against inadvertent misconfiguration at the networking layer.

Credits
-------

This middleware component is based on paul291's original
proof of concept, which was originally submitted as a PR to the
`falconry/falcon` repo.
